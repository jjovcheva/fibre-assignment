# Investigating the impact of fibre assignments on Fourier space galaxy clustering statistics

This repository contains some of the scripts and most of the measurements generated during my master's thesis
at the University of Edinburgh, which aimed to quantify and analyse the impact of fibre assignments and the 
efficacy of the nearest neighbour correction on the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum.

`cat_conversion.py` converts FITS catalogues to a format that is compatible with Triumvirate, the estimator
used to calculate the power spectra and bispectra (https://triumvirate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Shell files, draft scripts, and incomplete scripts (e.g. ones used to improve on the nearest neighbour correction
by modelling the distribution of the line of sight displacements between resolved galaxies and statistically
reconstructing the clustering, as described in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1609.01714) have been omitted for now.
